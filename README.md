# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. Users may select to include numbers, capital and lowercase letters, and/or symbols. They may also select to exclude similar and/or ambiguous characters. Validation rules are set such that the user must choose a password length between 8-128 characters and at least one character type is selected. Finally, users may select automatic selection of criteria. In this case, other selections are disabled and a password between 12-29 characters are created, including numbers, capital and lowercase letters, and symbols. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It is also responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
